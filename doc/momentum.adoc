== ADX

Average Directional Movement Index.

ADX is 100 * smoothed moving average of absolute value (DMI +/-) divided by (DMI+ + DMI-).

ADX does not indicate trend direction or momentum, only trend strength.

Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength.

An extremely strong trend is indicated by readings above 50.

=== CCI

Commodity Index Channel.

CCI is a versatile indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions.

CCI measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time.

The CCI typically oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations will occur within the range of
+100 and −100.

Readings above +100 imply an overbought condition, while readings below −100 imply an oversold condition.

As with other overbought/oversold indicators, this means that there is a large probability that the price will
correct to more representative levels.

=== MACD

Moving Average Convergence Divergence.

The MACD Line oscillates above and below the zero line, which is also known as the center-line.

These crossovers signal that the 12-day EMA has crossed the 26-day EMA. The direction, of course, depends on
the direction of the moving average cross.

Positive MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is above the 26-day EMA. Positive values increase as the shorter
EMA diverges further from the longer EMA.

This means upside momentum is increasing. Negative MACD values indicates that the 12-day EMA is below the
26-day EMA.

Negative values increase as the shorter EMA diverges further below the longer EMA. This means downside momentum
is increasing.

Signal line crossovers are the most common MACD signals. The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD Line.

As a moving average of the indicator, it trails the MACD and makes it easier to spot MACD turns.

A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line.

A bearish crossover occurs when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line.

=== MFI

Money Flow Indicator.

MFI is a momentum indicator that measures the inflow and outflow of money into a security over a specific
period of time.

MFI can be understood as RSI adjusted for volume.

The money flow indicator is one of the more reliable indicators of overbought and oversold conditions, perhaps
partly because it uses the higher readings of 80 and 20 as compared to the RSI's overbought/oversold readings
of 70 and 30.

=== ULTOSC

Ultimate Oscillator.

UO or ULTOSC is a momentum oscillator designed to capture momentum across three different time frames.

The multiple time frame objective seeks to avoid the pitfalls of other oscillators.

Many momentum oscillators surge at the beginning of a strong advance and then form bearish divergence as the
advance continues.

This is because they are stuck with one time frame. The Ultimate Oscillator attempts to correct this fault by
incorporating longer time frames into the basic formula.

=== VZO

V Zone Oscillator.

VZO uses price, previous price and moving averages to compute its oscillating value.

It is a leading indicator that calculates buy and sell signals based on oversold / overbought conditions.

Oscillations between the 5% and 40% levels mark a bullish trend zone, while oscillations between -40% and 5%
mark a bearish trend zone.

Meanwhile, readings above 40% signal an overbought condition, while readings above 60% signal an extremely
overbought condition.

Alternatively, readings below -40% indicate an oversold condition, which becomes extremely oversold below -60%.

=== WILLR

Williams %R

Williams %R, or just %R, is a technical analysis oscillator showing the current closing price in relation to
the high and low of the past N days (for a given N).

It was developed by a publisher and promoter of trading materials, Larry Williams.

It's purpose is to tell whether a stock or commodity market is trading near the high or the low, or somewhere in
between, of its recent trading range.

The oscillator is on a negative scale, from −100 (lowest) up to 0 (highest).
