=== TRIMA

Triangular Moving Average (TRIMA or TMA).

Represents an average of prices, but places weight on the middle prices of the time period.

The calculations double-smooth the data using a window width that is one-half the length of the series.

The TRIMA is simply the SMA of the SMA.

=== TRIX

Triple Exponential Moving Average Oscillator.

TRIX is a momentum indicator that oscillates around zero.

It displays the percentage rate of change between two triple smoothed exponential moving averages.

To calculate TRIX we calculate triple smoothed EMA3 of n periods and then subtract previous period EMA3 value

from last EMA3 value and divide the result with yesterdays EMA3 value.

=== KC

Keltner Channels.

KC are volatility-based envelopes set above and below an exponential moving average.

This indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands, which use the standard deviation to set the bands.

Instead of using the standard deviation, Keltner Channels use the Average True Range (ATR) to set channel
distance.

The channels are typically set two Average True Range values above and below the 20-day EMA.

The exponential moving average dictates direction and the Average True Range sets channel width.

Keltner Channels are a trend following indicator used to identify reversals with channel breakouts and channel
direction.

Chandelier Exit sets a trailing stop-loss based on the Average True Range (ATR).

The indicator is designed to keep traders in a trend and prevent an early exit as long as the trend extends.

Typically, the Chandelier Exit will be above prices during a downtrend and below prices during an uptrend.

=== BBANDS

Bollinger Bands.

Developed by John Bollinger, Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average.

Volatility is based on the standard deviation, which changes as volatility increases and decreases.
The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases.

This method allows input of some other form of moving average like EMA or KAMA around which BBAND will be
formed.

Pass desired moving average as <MA> argument. For example BBANDS(MA=TA.KAMA(20)).

This method returns other variations and derivatives of BBANDS as well.

Bandwidth tells how wide the Bollinger Bands are on a normalized basis.

---

=== DEMA

Double Exponential Moving Average.

DEMA indicator attempts to remove the inherent lag associated to Moving Averages by placing more weight on
recent values.

The name suggests this is achieved by applying a double exponential smoothing which is not the case.

The name double comes from the fact that the value of an EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is doubled.

To keep it in line with the actual data and to remove the lag the value "EMA of EMA" is subtracted from the
previously doubled EMA.

Because EMA(EMA) is used in the calculation, DEMA needs 2 * period -1 samples to start producing values in
contrast to the period samples needed by a regular EMA

=== EMA

Exponential Moving Average.

Like all moving average indicators, they are much better suited for trending markets.

When the market is in a strong and sustained uptrend, the EMA indicator line will also show an uptrend and
vice-versa for a down trend.

EMAs are commonly used in conjunction with other indicators to confirm significant market moves and to gauge
their validity.

=== ZLEMA

Zero Lag Moving Average.

ZLEMA is an abbreviation of Zero Lag Exponential Moving Average. It was developed by John Ehlers and Rick Way.

ZLEMA is a kind of Exponential moving average but its main idea is to eliminate the lag arising from the very
nature of the moving averages and other trend following indicators.

As it follows price closer, it also provides better price averaging and responds better to price swings.

=== APZ

Adaptive Price Zone.

APZ is as a volatility based indicator developed by Lee Leibfarth that appears as a set of bands placed over a
price chart.

Especially useful in non-trending, choppy markets, the APZ was created to help traders find potential turning
points in the markets.

=== SAR

SAR stands for “stop and reverse,” which is the actual indicator used in the system.

SAR trails price as the trend extends over time.

The indicator is below prices when prices are rising and above prices when prices are falling.

In this regard, the indicator stops and reverses when the price trend reverses and breaks above or below the
indicator.

Developed by John Bollinger, Bollinger Bands® are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average.

Volatility is based on the standard deviation, which changes as volatility increases and decreases.

The bands automatically widen when volatility increases and narrow when volatility decreases.

This method allows input of some other form of moving average like EMA or KAMA around which BBAND will be
formed.

Pass desired moving average as MA argument. For example BBANDS(MA=TA.KAMA(20)).

This method returns other variations and derivatives of BBANDS as well.

Bandwidth tells how wide the Bollinger Bands are on a normalized basis.

%b (pronounced "percent b") is derived from the formula for Stochastics and shows where price is in relation to
the bands.

%b equals 1 at the upper band and 0 at the lower band.

=== HMA

Hell's Moving Average.

HMA indicator is a common abbreviation of Hull Moving Average.

The average was developed by Allan Hull and is used mainly to identify the current market trend.

Unlike SMA (simple moving average) the curve of Hull moving average is considerably smoother.

Moreover, because its aim is to minimize the lag between HMA and price it does follow the price activity much
closer.

It is used especially for middle-term and long-term trading.

=== TEMA

Triple exponential moving average.

Attempts to remove the inherent lag associated to Moving Averages by placing more weight on recent values.

The name suggests this is achieved by applying a triple exponential smoothing which is not the case.

The name triple comes from the fact that the value of an EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is triple.

To keep it in line with the actual data and to remove the lag the value "EMA of EMA" is subtracted 3 times
from the previously tripled EMA.

Finally "EMA of EMA of EMA" is added.

Because EMA(EMA(EMA)) is used in the calculation, TEMA needs 3 * period - 2 samples to start producing values
in contrast to the period samples needed by a regular EMA.

=== VORTEX

Vortex Indicator.

The Vortex indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other
to identify negative price movement.

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods.

The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the
distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement.

Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while
weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length.
